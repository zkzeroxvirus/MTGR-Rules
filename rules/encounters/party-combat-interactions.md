# **⚔️ PARTY COMBAT INTERACTIONS**

The party shares one combat step and declares all attackers simultaneously, but each player remains the controller of their own creatures.

## Attacking alone and controller-local checks

For effects that care whether a creature **attacks alone**, or otherwise ask how many creatures **that player controls** attacked, evaluate each player's attackers separately.

Example:

* Player A attacks with exactly one creature.
* Player B also attacks with exactly one creature during the same party combat.
* Player A's creature is considered to have **attacked alone** for Player A.
* Player B's creature is considered to have **attacked alone** for Player B.
* Both players may therefore satisfy effects such as **Exalted** at the same time.

If Player A attacks with two creatures, Player A does not satisfy an "attacks alone" condition, even if every other ally attacks with only one creature.

## Shared attacking-creature checks

All creatures declared as attackers by the party are still part of the **same combat**. Effects that refer to attacking creatures without limiting them to creatures a particular player controls can see and affect allied attackers as normal.

Example:

* Player A attacks with one creature that has **Battle Cry**.
* Player B attacks with one creature in the same combat.
* Battle Cry treats Player B's creature as another attacking creature, so it receives the Battle Cry bonus.

## Adjacent blocking and blocking requirements

When a Host creature attacks a player, that player's adjacent allies may block for them under the normal adjacent-blocking rule. Creatures controlled by those adjacent allies count as blockers of that attacking creature for purposes of satisfying blocking requirements and restrictions.

Example:

* A Host creature with **Menace** attacks Player A.
* Player A controls only one creature that can block.
* An adjacent Player B may block the same attacking creature with one of their creatures.
* Player A's blocker and Player B's adjacent blocker together satisfy Menace's requirement that the creature be blocked by two or more creatures.

This same principle applies to other effects that care about how many creatures are blocking an attacker, unless the effect specifically restricts which player must control those blockers.

## General interpretation rule

Use the card's controller wording to decide which view applies:

* **"Attacks alone," "you attack," or "creatures you control attack"** → evaluate only that player's creatures unless the effect explicitly says otherwise.
* **"Attacking creature," "other attacking creatures," or another combat-wide reference without a controller restriction** → evaluate all applicable attacking creatures across the party's shared combat.
* The phrase **"you control"** always remains controller-specific; the shared party turn does not make allies' permanents count as permanents you control.
* Blocking requirements and restrictions are evaluated using all creatures legally blocking that attacker, including legal adjacent blockers, unless the effect explicitly requires blockers controlled by a specific player.

This interpretation applies to Exalted, Battle Cry, Menace, and other attack- or block-related effects with equivalent wording.
